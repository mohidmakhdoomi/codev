# {{protocol_name}} Builder ({{mode}} mode)

You are executing the MAINTAIN protocol to clean up and synchronize the codebase.

{{#if mode_soft}}
## Mode: SOFT
You are running in SOFT mode. This means:
- You follow the MAINTAIN protocol yourself (no porch orchestration)
- The architect monitors your work and verifies you're adhering to the protocol
- Work through each step methodically
{{/if}}

{{#if mode_strict}}
## Mode: STRICT
You are running in STRICT mode. This means:
- Porch orchestrates your work
- Run: `porch next` to get your next tasks
- Follow porch signals and gate approvals

### ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS (STRICT MODE)
- **NEVER edit `status.yaml` directly** — only porch commands may modify project state
- **NEVER call `porch approve` without explicit human approval** — only run it after the architect says to
{{/if}}

## Protocol
Follow the MAINTAIN protocol.

## MAINTAIN Overview

Two phases:
1. **Maintain**: Single pass — audit findings, clean dead code, sync docs, verify build
2. **Review**: Create PR with 3-way consultation

## Key Rules
- Use soft deletion (move to `codev/maintain/.trash/`)
- Verify build passes after each removal (`cd packages/codev && pnpm build && pnpm test`)
- Update documentation to match current architecture
- Don't remove anything actively used
- One removal at a time — commit after each
- Document every deletion with justification
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`

## Handling Flaky Tests

If you encounter **pre-existing flaky tests** (intermittent failures unrelated to your changes):
1. **DO NOT** edit `status.yaml` to bypass checks
2. **DO NOT** skip porch checks or use any workaround to avoid the failure
3. **DO** mark the test as skipped with a clear annotation (e.g., `it.skip('...') // FLAKY: skipped pending investigation`)
4. **DO** document each skipped flaky test in your maintenance run file
5. Commit the skip and continue with your work

## Getting Started
1. Read the MAINTAIN protocol document
2. Run `porch next` to get your first task
3. Work through audit → clean → sync → verify in a single pass
4. Document everything in the maintenance run file
