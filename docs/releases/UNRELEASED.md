# Unreleased

<!--
  Scratch accumulator for the next release's notes. Renamed to
  vX.Y.Z-<codename>.md at release time (via `git mv`), merged into main
  alongside the version bump.

  Per-PR architect workflow:
    1. cd worktrees/changelog                       # no fetch / no rebase — branches diverge by design
    2. Add the CHANGELOG entry to packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
       (add the [Unreleased] heading if it's missing — post-release state removes it)
    3. Add the matching release-notes entry to this file under the right section
       (substantive change → its own ## section; small item → Polish; non-vscode → Other fixes)
    4. Commit both files together; plain `git push` (fast-forward, no force)

  Why no rebase: main moves with code merges, docs/vscode-changelog moves with
  changelog/release-notes entries — neither branch touches the other's files
  between releases, so they diverge intentionally and reconcile at release time
  via merge (no conflicts expected). Rebasing on every PR merge rewrites this
  branch's commit hashes and forces force-pushes — pointless churn.

## Sidebar stops flickering empty during transient connection blips (#916, PR #976)

The Codev sidebar's four data-bearing views (Builders, Backlog, Pull Requests, Recently Closed) used to all blank simultaneously — while the Workspace view stayed populated — then recover on their own after some unknown interval. The bug was intermittent, hard to reproduce on demand, and rendered the architect's daily-driver surface untrustworthy at exactly the moments (network blip, Tower restart, SSE reconnect) when the user most wanted to see what was actually happening.

Root cause: the shared overview cache that backs those four views was overwriting populated data with `null` on a *transient* read — when the extension wasn't currently `connected` or when a `/api/overview` fetch failed. Every provider treats a falsy cache read as an empty list, so a single null commit blanked all four views at once. The Workspace view stayed populated because it reads from different sources (it doesn't depend on `/api/overview`), which was the discriminating signal that ruled out the obvious-but-wrong theory ("Tower must be sending empty data").

The fix is straightforward once the diagnosis lands: the cache now holds **last-known-good** data. Transient reads no longer clobber the cache; only a successful fetch commits a new value; and a dedicated reconnect refresh re-syncs the moment the connection is re-established. The no-flicker invariant is pinned at the event level too — `onDidChange` only fires on a successful commit, never on a transient/failed read, so providers aren't even asked to re-render mid-blip.

Trade-off by design: a *long* Tower outage now shows **stale** fleet data rather than blanking. The issue's acceptance explicitly chose stale-over-blank — a distinct "disconnected" visual treatment for the data-views is a separate concern, deliberately out of scope here. The cache continues to hold the last value it saw until either a successful fetch commits a fresher one or the user explicitly refreshes.

## Builders tree group-by-stage (action axis) with stage/area toggle (#952, PR #970)

The Builders sidebar tree used to group by `area/*` label — the same axis the Backlog tree uses. That's the right grouping for Backlog ("what should I pick up next?" → domain) but wrong for Builders, where the real question is "what's blocking me right now?" → action. With area-grouping you had to expand every group and scan each row's `[<phase>]` prefix to find the builders needing your attention.

This release swaps the axes for Builders specifically: the group rows are now the builder's lifecycle stage (`SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW → PR → VERIFIED`, in lifecycle order, empty stages hidden), and each row reads `[<area>] #<id> <title>`. "Show me everything blocked at plan-approval" is now one group expand instead of an N-row scan.

The grouping is **toggleable** for reviewers who prefer the domain view: a title-bar button (`$(tag)` shows when in stage mode, `$(milestone)` shows when in area mode) flips both the group axis *and* the row prefix. Setting: `codev.buildersGroupBy` (`"stage"` default, or `"area"`). Per-mode collapse state is independent and persists across reloads — collapsing the IMPLEMENT group in stage mode doesn't collapse `area/vscode` in area mode.

Two implementation details worth a conscious nod:

- **A closed canonical 6-stage set** caps the group count at 7 (the 6 named stages plus `UNKNOWN`) regardless of how many protocols Codev adds. New phases that aren't in the `PHASE_TO_STAGE` map degrade gracefully to `UNKNOWN` rather than spawning a new top-level group. Adding a real bucket for a future phase is one map entry.
- **PIR/SPIR builders awaiting merge sit under `REVIEW`, not `PR`.** Only AIR and BUGFIX model `pr` as a *phase* (so they appear under `PR`); PIR and SPIR model it as a *gate on the review phase*. The grouping is faithful to each protocol's own phase model — a PIR builder you've just approved sits in `REVIEW` until it advances to `verified`.

Backlog grouping is unaffected by all of this — it remains area-grouped because "domain" really is the right axis for "what should I pick up?".

## Terminal reconnect overhaul + click-to-recover affordance (#936, #939, PR #962)

A Codev terminal whose WebSocket dies — Tower restart, a forgotten session id, a transient network blip — used to fill the pane with `[Codev: Connection lost, reconnecting...]` lines in a tight loop. No backoff, no give-up, no actual reconnect — and the comment in the code claimed the terminal-manager handled reconnection while in fact nothing subscribed. The architect's real output kept flowing into a live Tower-side PTY, buried under the spam.

This release rewires the terminal adapter to *own* its reconnect loop:

- **Exponential backoff** (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s) instead of fire-as-fast-as-possible. The pane now shows one `[Codev: retrying in Ns (attempt n/6)]` line per interval, not several per second.
- **Bounded retry**: after 6 attempts (~63s total under the backoff curve), the adapter stops and prints a red failure line. No more terminals stuck in an unbounded loop.
- **Fast-give-up on stale-session**: when Tower's WebSocket close-frame indicates the session id is unknown (i.e. Tower restarted, the PTY is gone), the adapter recognises the case from the upgrade-error string and surfaces the red give-up immediately — no waiting through 6 retries for a hopeless retry chain.
- **Stream-state isolation across reconnects**: the terminal's ANSI decoder and escape-sequence buffer are reset *before* each scheduled reconnect, so a half-received escape sequence from the dead socket can't corrupt the new one's output. An identity guard on the close handler also prevents the *old* socket's late-arriving `close` from scheduling a stray retry against a healthy reconnected socket — a class of bug that bit a prior attempt at this fix.

On top of that give-up state, **#939** ships a recovery affordance: the red failure line carries a clickable `Reconnect` token (via a terminal link provider). One click starts a fresh retry chain from the same terminal — repeatable, so a "click → retry → fail again → click" cycle works every time. The user no longer needs to close the terminal tab and re-open via the sidebar / command palette to recover.

Targeting works correctly across multiple terminals: the click reconnects the terminal whose line was clicked, not whichever terminal happens to be active.

A follow-up (#961) tracks consolidating the four duplicated copies of the exponential-backoff curve (this adapter, the SSE connection-manager, the dashboard's web terminal, the tunnel client) into a single `@cluesmith/codev-core` policy — including the design call on whether the dashboard's web terminal should adopt the same 6-attempt give-up and stale-session fast-path it currently lacks.

## Area-header roll-up icons (#926, PR #959)

The `area/*` group headers in the Backlog and Builders sidebar trees now carry a status glyph that summarises what's inside, so you can triage areas at a glance without expanding each group.

The two views answer different questions and the rollup vocabularies reflect that:

- **Backlog** is **binary** — filled grey dot if the area has any builder working it, outline grey if it's purely open work waiting to be spawned. The Backlog asks "is anyone working this area?", and grey reads as a calm "where can I spawn?" surface rather than overloading the green that builder rows reserve for *live agents*.
- **Builders** is a **worst-of-three** — yellow `bell` if any builder in the group is blocked at a gate, blue `comment-discussion` if any are idle, green `circle-filled` only if all are active. Reuses the per-row glyph vocabulary so the header is a literal summary of what's below it. The full `{b blocked · i waiting · a active}` breakdown lives in the tooltip.

A consequence worth a conscious nod: the same area can show a filled-grey Backlog header (has a builder) while its Builders header reads yellow `bell` (that builder is blocked). That's intended — the two views are different questions, and the headers answer each in its own register.

One known limitation, tracked as a follow-up: an area whose only open issue is being built has the issue filtered out of the Backlog today, so the area renders no Backlog header at all. #948 explores keeping in-progress issues in the Backlog with the builder's state icon, which would close that gap.

## Search Backlog editor-tab webview (#920, PR #957)

The Backlog view's title bar gains a 🔍 icon that opens a new **Search Backlog** editor-tab panel — a full editor-area webview built for exploratory triage where the always-on sidebar tree and the Quick Pick both fall short.

Filter the open backlog by Area, Assignee, and Author (three native-styled dropdowns that AND together); substring-search title **and body** with a debounced live query; sort any column; row click opens the issue and the ↪ inline action references it in the architect chat with `#<id> "<title>"`. A match-count footer reads `N matches found · by-area breakdown`.

Three modes: `Open` (default, mirrors the sidebar's PR-excluded backlog), `Closed` (lifts the PR exclusion since closed issues usually have a merged PR), `All`. The panel is a singleton — re-invoking the command focuses the existing tab instead of stacking duplicates. Themed via CSS variables only, so dark / light / high-contrast all render cleanly without per-theme code.

This panel coexists with the sidebar Backlog tree and the `Codev: Search Backlog…` Quick Pick (#918) rather than replacing either. The sidebar is at-a-glance "what's on my plate"; Quick Pick is muscle-memory "I know it exists, find it, dismiss"; this panel is "scan, filter, sort, refine". Supersedes the closed #906.

## Codev CLI preflight on extension activation (#791, PR #955)

The extension now verifies, on every startup, that the `codev` CLI is installed on `PATH` and at a version at least as new as itself. The probe is fire-and-forget and bounded to 400ms so activation isn't blocked; the result caches for the session. Until #791 this dependency was implicit — a missing or out-of-date CLI surfaced only as a confusing "not connected to Tower" error from deep in the activation path, with no actionable guidance.

Three outcomes branch the UX:

- **OK** — no toast, no walkthrough. A new **Codev CLI** row in the sidebar's Status view shows the detected version with a green check.
- **Missing** — the new `Get started with Codev` walkthrough opens automatically (once per workspace), with three steps: detect (`codev --version`), install (`npm install -g @cluesmith/codev`, with Node ≥20 prereq surfaced), and verify.
- **Outdated** — a warning notification offers `Update via npm` (one-click install in an integrated terminal, with a re-verify that fires only when *that specific terminal* closes with a success exit code), `Open Install Docs`, or dismiss.

The Status row carries a recheck button on `missing`/`outdated` states (intentionally not on the ≤400ms `pending` probe window — a recheck button there is meaningless and would risk a second concurrent `codev --version`). A new `Codev: Recheck CLI` command exposes the same recovery path from the palette. Dismissing the prompt leaves Codev commands registered but no-op'ing with a single "run setup" toast rather than crashing — guarded commands fall through cleanly until the CLI is sorted out.

The walkthrough's Verify step completion keys off `onContext:codev.cliReady`, so a failed recheck doesn't falsely tick the step — only a genuinely successful preflight does.

- **Run / Stop Dev Server entries hide when `worktree.devCommand` isn't configured** (#975, PR #978). The Workspace view's Start row has always honoured this gating, but the builder-row context menu, dev keybindings (`Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+R`/`S`), and command palette didn't — they would surface on every blocked builder regardless, then fail with a missing-command error on click. All four surfaces now share a single `codev.hasDevCommand` context key, refreshed by the same global signals (`onStateChange` + `worktree-config-updated` SSE) that already drive the Workspace view's gate, so add / remove / edit `worktree.devCommand` in `.codev/config.json` and every gated surface updates live without a window reload. Also fixes a latent Workspace-view bug: `"devCommand": ""` (empty string) used to render a Start row that errored on click; now treated as absent.
- **Neutral inline gate-action icon on builder rows** (#933, PR #963). The inline action button on a blocked builder row used to show a `✓` checkmark regardless of which gate the builder was at — implying "approve" even when the underlying action might be View Plan or Run Dev. It's now a neutral `→` arrow. Behaviour is unchanged (same click flow); per-gate triage continues to live on the row's *leading* icon (the gate-specific glyph from the same icon vocabulary shipped earlier this cycle).
- **`[new]` prefix on freshly-created backlog rows** (#930, PR #949). Backlog items whose `createdAt` is within the last 24 hours now lead with a `[new]` prefix right after the issue number — e.g. `#930 [new] vscode: mark recently-created...`. The threshold is re-evaluated on every tree render so items naturally lose the prefix as they age past 24h, no per-user state, no manual dismissal. The `OverviewBacklogItem.createdAt` field was already on the wire from earlier work, so this was a pure UI-layer change in `packages/vscode/src/views/backlog.ts` plus a new `backlog-recency.ts` pure helper with vitest coverage. Architect made an in-flight placement call at dev-approval (commit `5ff73ac4`) to lead the row with `[new]` rather than trail it; commit `16cb365c` reconciled the plan and review docs to match the shipped order.
- **`Open Builder Terminal` and `Send Message` Quick Picks show `#<id> <title>`** (#925, PR #951). The two outlier builder pickers (palette commands `Codev: Open Builder Terminal` and `Codev: Send Message to Builder`) previously labelled rows with the internal builder name (e.g. `pir-1333`), while the seven other builder pickers in the extension already used the `#<id> <title>` format. This fix brings the two outliers into line. Mechanical `.map()` change in each picker's source; data was already on the wire via the same `getWorkspaceState` endpoint the canonical pickers consume. Surfaced a follow-up: there's no Send-Message-to-Architect Quick Pick at all — filed as #950.

## Other fixes (dashboard, porch, infrastructure)

<!--
Non-vscode work that ships in the npm release goes here. Same bullet shape
as Polish above.
-->

- **Web dashboard terminal now gives up after 6 reconnect attempts (was 50), and the refresh button truly reconnects from the dead-socket state** (#961, PR #972). The web terminal used to retry a failed WebSocket up to 50 times before stopping, and its refresh button only resized a *live* socket — clicking it after the terminal had given up did nothing useful. Both surfaces now share the same bounded reconnect curve used by the VS Code terminal (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s, give-up after 6 attempts, fresh retry chain on a true reconnect), so dashboard users get the same actionable give-up state VS Code users got in #936 and the refresh button is now the recovery affordance it always looked like. A follow-up (#971) tracks adopting the stale-session fast-path on the web side too once Tower emits a browser-visible close code.
- **Directory entries in `worktree.symlinks` via trailing-slash opt-in** (#805, PR #947). `worktree.symlinks` previously dropped directory matches silently — the `nodir: true` glob flag intentionally kept a footgun guard against a pattern like `"apps/auth"` symlinking the worktree's source over the parent's. A new trailing-slash form (`".local-user-data/"`) is treated as a literal-path directory symlink; entries without a trailing slash keep their existing file-only behavior (footgun guard intact). Use case: sharing per-worktree runtime state directories (gitignored, intentionally not branch-isolated) so builders boot against the parent's existing state instead of bootstrapping from scratch. Windows handled via `symlinkSync(src, dest, 'dir')`; glob metacharacters inside a trailing-slash entry emit a warning rather than silently mis-expanding.
