#!/bin/sh
# Set every workspace package to the same version, anchored on the root
# package.json's version field. The root is private (never published), but
# its version is the canonical "what version is this monorepo" — same pattern
# used by Vue (vuejs/core) and Babel (babel/babel).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bump-all.sh                 # default: patch bump from root version
#   scripts/bump-all.sh patch           # patch bump (same as no-arg)
#   scripts/bump-all.sh minor           # minor bump
#   scripts/bump-all.sh major           # major bump
#   scripts/bump-all.sh 3.1.0-rc.1      # explicit version (for RCs, etc.)
#
# This script only rewrites the version field of each package.json — it does
# NOT commit or tag (so no `--no-git-tag-version` passthrough is needed,
# unlike `pnpm version` which auto-commits by default). It also does NOT
# reformat the JSON: the version line is patched in place so hand-formatted
# files (e.g. packages/vscode/package.json with compact view arrays) are
# preserved byte-for-byte outside the version field. Stage, commit, and tag
# yourself afterward.
#
# VS Code Marketplace rejects semver pre-release suffixes (e.g. 1.7.0-rc.1),
# so packages/vscode is skipped when VERSION contains a '-'. The extension
# catches up when an RC is promoted to a stable version.
