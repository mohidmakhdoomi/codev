# PIR #975 — gate builder-row Run/Stop Dev Server on `worktree.devCommand`

## Plan phase (iteration 1)

Investigated the surface. Root cause confirmed: builder-row dev menu entries
(`package.json:386-394`) gate on view+viewItem family only, no config gate. The
Workspace view rows work because their `viewItem` (`workspace-dev-start/stop`) is
only emitted when `devCommand` is set (`workspace.ts:185`).

Key findings driving the plan:
- Config resolves via `loadWorktreeConfig()` → Tower's 5-layer merge (already
  shared+local layered). Reuse it; no new resolver.
- Live-refresh precedent: `WorkspaceProvider` re-renders on the
  `worktree-config-updated` SSE envelope (`workspace.ts:43-53`). Mirror that for
  the context key → satisfies acceptance #5 (no reload).
- `.codev/config.json` is always symlinked into worktrees ⇒ devCommand identical
  across builder rows ⇒ a single global `codev.hasDevCommand` key is the truth.
  Per-row metadata = future work only.
- Latent bug: `workspace.ts:185` uses `devCommand !== null`, so `"devCommand": ""`
  would show a Start row that errors on click. dev-shared.ts uses `!devCommand`.
  Resolving with a shared `hasRunnableDevCommand` (trim non-empty) helper used by
  both surfaces.

Decisions (issue's 6 design Qs): live SSE-driven key; layered config; single
global key; gate keybindings + palette too; empty-string = absent. All laid out
in the plan for the reviewer to redirect at the gate.

Plan written to `codev/plans/975-vscode-run-stop-dev-server-con.md`. Awaiting
plan-approval.

## Implement phase (iteration 1)

Plan approved. Implemented the `codev.hasDevCommand` context-key gate.

Design evolved during pre-commit review with the architect:
- Started with an SSE-driven key (mirrors WorkspaceProvider: onStateChange +
  `worktree-config-updated` envelope). Architect pushed back: the context menu
  is on-demand/ephemeral, unlike the always-on Workspace view — it doesn't
  warrant a constant config-file listener.
- Considered a visibility-snapshot (refresh on Builders view `onDidChangeVisibility`).
  Rejected: split wiring + staleness if config edited while view already visible.
- **Landed on render-path**: `BuildersProvider.refreshDevCommandContext()` called
  fire-and-forget from `getChildren`'s root branch. The key tracks the same
  cadence as the rows the menu gates; no dedicated listener; fully co-located in
  the provider (extension.ts only passes connectionManager). Liveness: picks up
  config edits on the next tree refresh (overview poll / tree event).

Also fixed a latent empty-string bug: `workspace.ts` used `devCommand !== null`
(would show a Start row for `"devCommand": ""` that errors on click). Both
surfaces now share `hasRunnableDevCommand()` (trim non-empty).

Surfaces gated: builder-row context menu (the bug), dev keybindings, and
workspace-dev palette entries; builder-row dev palette entries pinned `when:false`
(need a row arg — same as view{Spec,Plan,Review}File).

Build + type-check clean; 276 unit tests pass (incl. 2 new test files:
has-runnable-dev-command + menu-when-clauses additions). Lint clean.

Pushing and signaling dev-approval — reviewer verifies the running worktree.
