# PIR #1187 — Upgrade TypeScript to 6.0.3 (unify 5.7/5.9 drift)

## Plan phase

- Repo layout differs from issue: `dashboard`→`apps/web`, `vscode`→`apps/vscode`. 6 packages carry a `typescript` devDep (apps/web ^5.7.0, apps/vscode ^5.9.3, packages/{types,core,artifact-canvas} ^5.7.0, packages/codev ^5.7.2).
- **Version decision surfaced**: npm `latest` is now **7.0.2**; 6.0.3 is the latest 6.x stable. Issue scopes to 6.x → recommending 6.0.3, flagging TS 7 as out-of-scope for architect.
- **Did full empirical verification at plan time** (issue asked for it). Bumped all 6 → ^6.0.3, `pnpm install`, ran check-types/build/test/vscode:prepublish, captured real diagnostics, then reverted to clean. Verified diff saved to scratchpad.

### Verified fallout + fixes (all confirmed green end-to-end)
1. TS 6 defaults `types: []` (was: auto-include all `@types/*`). Breaks `@types/node` resolution (even `node:fs` imports → TS2591) in `core` (9 errs) + `codev` (22 errs). Fix: add `"types": ["node"]` to those two tsconfigs (both already depend on @types/node). `packages/types` needs nothing (0 errs, no node usage).
2. `types: []` also drops `vite/client` → CSS side-effect imports fail (TS2882) in apps/web. Fix: new `apps/web/src/vite-env.d.ts` with `/// <reference types="vite/client" />`.
3. apps/vscode's 98 "errors" were all **false cascades** from core being unbuilt (no dist/.d.ts). After core builds: host 0, webview 0. No vscode source changes needed.
4. `baseUrl` deprecation is now a hard error (TS5101) — surfaced via artifact-canvas's **tsup** DTS build (rollup-plugin-dts injects baseUrl). → resolved by the tsup→tsdown swap below (cleaner than `ignoreDeprecations: "6.0"` bandaid).

### User request (mid-plan): swap tsup → tsdown (tsup unmaintained)
- Verified: tsdown 0.22.8 (rolldown-powered) builds artifact-canvas clean, no baseUrl error.
- tsdown output naming differs from tsup: `index.mjs`/`index.d.mts` (ESM) + `index.cjs`/`index.d.cts` (CJS). Required updating artifact-canvas `exports`/`main`/`module`/`types` to match, and `scripts/smoke.mjs` (hardcoded old `dist/index.js`/`index.d.ts`).
- react/react-dom auto-externalized (peerDeps) — dropped the deprecated `external` option.
- Downstream consumers (apps/web, vscode webview) resolve the new exports fine.

### No-ops (verified)
- No `engines.node` bump: TS 6.0.3 declares `>=14.17`, repo already `>=20.0.0`.
- No `@types/node` bump: 22.x works.
- No tsconfig deprecated-option removal: all tsconfigs already modern (NodeNext/ES2022/strict, no baseUrl/classic/paths).

### Open decisions for architect at plan gate
- **A. Target version**: 6.0.3 (recommended, per issue scope) vs 7.0.2 (new major, native compiler — out of issue scope).
- **B. pnpm `catalog:` entry** (issue asked): recommend adding one to kill future drift; described in plan.

Plan written to `codev/plans/1187-chore-upgrade-typescript-to-6-.md`. Awaiting plan-approval gate.
