# PIR Plan: Builders tree groups by phase (action axis), area becomes the row prefix

> **Addendum (scope expansion, agreed at the dev-approval gate)** — after the swap landed, user feedback showed some reviewers prefer the area-grouping. Rather than commit to a one-way swap, #952 now ships **both axes with a title-bar toggle**, defaulting to stage. The issue itself listed this toggle under *Out of scope → "could be a follow-up if the swap turns out to be controversial"*; the architect chose to bundle it into #952. The body below describes the stage-grouping swap (still the default); the **"Toggle addendum"** section at the end documents the dual-mode design layered on top. Both are implemented and verified.

## Understanding

Today the VSCode **Builders** tree groups rows by their `area/*` label (`groupByArea(ordered, b => b.area)` in `packages/vscode/src/views/builders.ts:147`), and each row's label leads with the phase: `[<phase>] #<id> <title>` (`builderRowLabel` in `packages/vscode/src/views/builder-row.ts:149-160`). That mirrors the Backlog tree (#811/#818), which was a deliberate "one mental model across views" call.

The issue argues the two views answer different questions:

- **Backlog** = "what should I pick up next?" → grouping by **domain** (area) is right.
- **Builders** = "what's blocking me / where do I act?" → grouping by **phase** is right ("show me everything at plan-approval", "everything sitting at implement", "everything waiting on a PR merge"). Area-grouping forces a reverse scan: open every area group and read each row's `[<phase>]` prefix to mentally collect a phase.

**The swap**: group the Builders tree by `protocolPhase`; move `area` into the row prefix (`[<area>] #<id> <title>`). Backlog stays area-grouped. The state-color/gate-icon system from #810 (`gateIconFor`, `BUILDER_STATE_GLYPH`, `rollupGroupState`) composes orthogonally and is preserved.

### Data facts that shape the design

- `OverviewBuilder.protocolPhase` (`packages/types/src/api.ts:148`) is the coarse protocol phase — the raw `phase:` from `status.yaml`. Phase ids by bundled protocol: **spir/aspir** = `specify/plan/implement/review/verify`; **pir** = `plan/implement/review`; **air** = `implement/pr`; **bugfix** = `investigate/fix/pr`; **maintain** = `maintain/review`; **experiment** = `hypothesis/design/execute/analyze`; **research** = `scope/investigate/synthesize/critique`; **spike** = `spike`. Terminal status values that also surface as `protocolPhase`: `verified` / `complete`. Empty string when no live status exists.
- `OverviewBuilder.area` wire values are lowercase (`vscode`, `tower`, `cross-cutting`), with the `Uncategorized` sentinel (`UNCATEGORIZED_AREA`, `packages/core/src/constants.ts:14`) when the builder's issue has no `area/*` label.
- The Builders dashboard has **no** builders-by-area grouping (`grep` of `packages/dashboard/src` finds no `groupByArea`/`protocolPhase`) — so this is genuinely VSCode-only; there is no parallel dashboard view to keep in sync.

## Proposed Change

### 1. New pure core helper `groupByStage` (closed canonical stage set)

Add `packages/core/src/phase-grouping.ts` — sibling to `area-grouping.ts`. Rather than minting one group per raw phase id (which produces a ~19-wide vocabulary across 9 protocols), it maps every protocol's phase ids onto a **closed, fixed set of 6 canonical lifecycle stages**, then buckets by stage. **This caps the tree at 7 groups maximum (6 stages + `unknown`), permanently — independent of how many protocols/phases Codev ever adds.** A new protocol's phases route into an existing stage (or fall to `unknown` until mapped); the group count never grows with the protocol catalog.

The closed stage set, in fixed display order:

```
SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW → PR → VERIFIED        (+ UNKNOWN, last)
```

#### Phase → stage mapping (`PHASE_TO_STAGE`)

Every phase id authored across all 9 bundled protocols folds into one stage:

| Canonical stage | Phase ids that map to it | Source protocols |
|---|---|---|
| **specify** | specify · hypothesis · scope | spir/aspir · experiment · research |
| **plan** | plan · design · investigate | spir/aspir/pir · experiment · bugfix/research |
| **implement** | implement · fix · execute · maintain · spike | spir/aspir/pir/air · bugfix · experiment · maintain · spike |
| **review** | review · synthesize · analyze · critique | spir/aspir/pir/maintain · research · experiment · research |
| **pr** | pr | air · bugfix |
| **verified** | verify · verified · complete | spir/aspir · (terminal, all) |
| *(unknown)* | `""` + any unrecognized future phase id | catch-all |

Rules:
- A builder's `protocolPhase` is looked up in `PHASE_TO_STAGE`; the resulting stage is its bucket.
- **`verify`, `verified`, and `complete` all fold into the `verified` stage** — this subsumes the earlier `complete`→`verified` normalization *and* merges SPIR's in-progress `verify` phase into the same terminal bucket (the row's state icon still distinguishes an active verify from a done builder).
- **Empty `protocolPhase` OR any unrecognized future phase id → `unknown`** (a single bounded catch-all, not a per-phase tail). Keeps the cap fixed; a new protocol whose phase isn't yet mapped surfaces under UNKNOWN rather than silently vanishing or expanding the group set.
- Stages emit in the fixed order above; **empty stages are omitted** (a bucket exists only if ≥1 builder maps into it) — satisfies the "hide empty groups" acceptance criterion.
- Within a stage, input order is preserved (display-order sort already applied upstream).

Signature (mirrors `groupByArea`; the getter still extracts the raw phase, the mapping happens inside):

```ts
export type BuilderStage = 'specify' | 'plan' | 'implement' | 'review' | 'pr' | 'verified' | 'unknown';

export function groupByStage<T>(
  items: T[],
  getPhase: (item: T) => string,
): Array<{ stage: BuilderStage; items: T[] }>
```

`PHASE_TO_STAGE`, the `STAGE_ORDER` array, and `BuilderStage` are all exported so the mapping/order is testable and documented in one place.

#### Why a closed set (vs the issue's "append protocol-specific phases after VERIFIED")

The issue's design-call #1 said to append protocol-specific phases (`INVESTIGATE`, `FIX`, …) as their *own* groups after VERIFIED. Auditing the full phase inventory showed that produces up to ~19 distinct groups (every phase across all 9 protocols), which defeats the at-a-glance triage goal. **Per architect direction, this plan supersedes that**: protocol-specific phases fold into the 6 canonical stages instead. See "Acceptance criteria delta" below — the issue's bullet about appended protocol phases is replaced.

> **Design call #1 (stage set & order) — locked**: closed 6-stage set `SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW → PR → VERIFIED` (+ `UNKNOWN` last), with `PHASE_TO_STAGE` folding all 17 phase ids in. `investigate → plan` (treats it as pre-build diagnosis — correct for the common BUGFIX case; RESEARCH's investigate approximates here). `verify`/`verified`/`complete → verified`. Unrecognized/empty → `unknown`. **PR and VERIFIED stay separate** (not merged): PR is an *action-needed* stage ("needs a merge" — one of the issue's headline triage queries), VERIFIED is terminal/no-action; conflating them would defeat the merge-triage query for a one-group saving against an already-low cap.
>
> **Design call #2 (empty groups) — locked**: hidden entirely (a bucket only exists if it has members).

Display label reuses the existing uppercase convention (`uppercaseAreaName` is a pure `.toUpperCase()` — works on stage strings unchanged; no new display helper needed): `IMPLEMENT (3)`, `PLAN (1)`, etc.

### 2. `builders.ts` — group by stage

- Swap `groupByArea(ordered, b => b.area)` → `groupByStage(ordered, b => b.protocolPhase)` in both `rootChildren()` (line 147) and `rowsForGroup()` (line 179).
- `rowsForGroup` matches on `g.stage` instead of `g.area`; its param is renamed `stage`.
- Group-item construction passes the stage string: `new BuilderGroupTreeItem(g.stage, g.items.length, state, rollupGroupState(g.items, now))`.
- **Remove the single-`Uncategorized` flatten special case** (lines 153-156). That branch existed because an Uncategorized-only result means "this repo doesn't use the area axis at all" — grouping adds nothing. The phase axis always applies (every live builder has a phase), so there is no analogous "axis absent" degenerate. Builders always render under a phase-group header. `getParent`/`groupParentByBuilderId` therefore always populate (simplifies the accordion path — no flatten branch to special-case).
  - Edge note: if every builder has empty `protocolPhase`, the result is a single `UNKNOWN` group. We accept the header in that rare transient case rather than reintroducing a flatten — it's self-describing ("nothing has a phase yet").

> **Design call #4 (blocked builders) — locked**: blocked builders stay in their **semantic phase group** (no synthetic `BLOCKED` group). A builder blocked on `plan-approval` is still `protocolPhase: plan` → lands in the `PLAN` group with its warning-yellow `checklist` gate icon. The icon color conveys state; the group conveys phase. This is already how `protocolPhase` behaves at a pending gate (the phase doesn't advance until the gate is approved), so no extra logic is needed.

### 3. `builder-row.ts` — `builderRowLabel`: area prefix instead of phase prefix

Replace the `phasePrefix` with an `areaPrefix`:

```ts
const areaPrefix = b.area && b.area !== UNCATEGORIZED_AREA ? `[${b.area}] ` : '';
return `${areaPrefix}#${b.issueId ?? b.id} ${b.issueTitle ?? ''}${stateLabel}`;
```

- Phase is now implicit from group containment, so it leaves the row label entirely.
- The blocked/idle `stateLabel` suffix logic (`blocked on <label> [<elapsed>]` / `waiting on input [<elapsed> silent]`) is **unchanged**.
- The JSDoc block (currently describing the phase-prefix rationale) is rewritten to describe the area-prefix.

> **Design call #3 (prefix format) — locked**: `[vscode]` — lowercase, raw area echo, no `area/` prefix. Area wire values are already lowercase, so this is a direct echo. **`Uncategorized` is omitted** (no `[Uncategorized]` noise — mirrors today's empty-phase omission).
>
> **Design call #5 (cross-cutting) — locked**: keep `[cross-cutting]` verbatim (no `[shared]` shorthand — shorthand invites "is it the same as cross-cutting?" confusion).

This pulls `UNCATEGORIZED_AREA` into `builder-row.ts` (import from `@cluesmith/codev-core/constants`) — the module stays vscode-free, so it remains unit-testable under the vitest harness.

### 4. Expansion persistence — reuse the generic store with a new key

The existing `AreaGroupExpansionStore` (`area-group-expansion.ts`) is already generic: it stores `Record<string, boolean>` keyed by whatever string the caller passes (`set(name, expanded)`), defaulting untouched groups to expanded. Only its name says "Area".

- In `builders.ts`, change the store's storage key from `codev.buildersGroupExpansion` → **`codev.buildersStageGroupExpansion`**. Old area-keyed entries under the old key become stale and harmless (never read again) — exactly the issue's "old `BuilderGroupExpansion` entries become stale and harmless" outcome.
- `persistAreaGroupExpansion` wires `view.onDidExpand/Collapse` → `store.set(e.element.areaName, …)`. Since `BuilderGroupTreeItem` now carries the **stage** string in its `areaName` field (see #5 below), expansion persists keyed by stage with no change to the helper.

> **Design call #6 (persistence) — locked**: reuse the generic store with a new key (the DRY equivalent of the issue's "parallel `PhaseGroupExpansionStore`" — same outcome: a separate storage namespace keyed by stage, old area entries orphaned). A full class rename is avoided to keep churn surgical. **#913 coordination**: #913 (make builder group-expansion ephemeral) is still OPEN/unmerged; this plan proceeds with persistence as-is. If #913 lands first, it converts this store to ephemeral — the new key is forward-compatible with that change (it just becomes the in-memory key).

### 5. `BuilderGroupTreeItem` / `AreaGroupTreeItem` — pass stage into the existing slot

Per the issue's explicit guidance ("The `BuilderGroupTreeItem` shape stays the same; just receives a phase name instead of an area name"), the base `AreaGroupTreeItem` is **not** renamed. `BuilderGroupTreeItem` receives the stage string in its first constructor arg (currently named `areaName`). Mechanically:

- `id` becomes `builder-group:<stage>` (e.g. `builder-group:implement`) — still stable per group, so VSCode persists expansion across cache ticks.
- `contextValue` stays `builder-group` (menu scoping unchanged).
- Label is `uppercaseAreaName(stage)` → `IMPLEMENT (3)`.

A clarifying comment is added to `BuilderGroupTreeItem` noting its `areaName` slot now carries a stage (the base remains shared with the genuinely-area-keyed Backlog header). The base field name stays `areaName` to avoid a cross-view rename touching Backlog; this is a deliberate surgical-scope call (the field is the generic "group key" — Backlog's is an area, Builders' is a stage).

#### Group header icon — keep the worst-of-state rollup (unchanged behavior)

`BuilderGroupTreeItem` keeps its #926 **worst-of-state rollup icon**: any member blocked → yellow `bell`; else any idle → blue `comment-discussion`; else green `circle-filled`; tooltip `"<b> blocked · <i> waiting · <a> active"`. `builders.ts` already passes `rollupGroupState(g.items, now)` into the constructor; that line is unchanged.

> **Design call #7 (group header icons) — locked**: header icon stays the worst-of-**state** rollup, NOT a per-stage identity icon. Rationale: the header *label* already names the stage; the *icon* must carry the orthogonal "does this group need attention" signal (the action-axis payload). A static stage icon would be redundant with the label and would discard the at-a-glance blocked signal. Generic `bell` (not a gate-specific shape) because a stage can hold builders blocked at different gates — the warning *color* is the group-level signal, the row icons carry per-gate shape. The only header change is **cosmetic**: rename the "area-group" prose/JSDoc in `builder-tree-item.ts` to "stage-group". Edge: the `VERIFIED` stage's finished builders roll up green/active — accepted (matches current behavior; not worth special-casing).

### 6. Backlog tree — untouched

`backlog.ts` keeps `groupByArea`. No changes. Acceptance criterion "Backlog tree's `area/*` grouping is unaffected" is met by not touching it.

## Acceptance criteria delta (vs the issue text)

The issue's acceptance list predates the architect's "reduce max groups" direction. Two bullets change:

- **REPLACED** — issue: *"Phase groups render in lifecycle order: SPECIFY → … → VERIFIED; protocol-specific phases (e.g. INVESTIGATE, FIX) appended after VERIFIED."* → now: *"Builder rows group into a closed set of 6 canonical stages (SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW → PR → VERIFIED) in that fixed order; every protocol's phase ids fold into these stages via `PHASE_TO_STAGE` (no per-phase groups); unmapped/empty phases fall to a trailing UNKNOWN group. Max 7 groups regardless of protocol count."*
- **UNCHANGED** — group by porch phase not `area/*`; empty groups hidden; row label `[<area>] #<id> <title>`; blocked builders stay in their semantic stage (no synthetic BLOCKED); backlog unaffected; counts accurate.

All other acceptance criteria carry over verbatim.

## Files to Change

- `packages/core/src/phase-grouping.ts` — **new**. `groupByStage` + `PHASE_TO_STAGE` map + `STAGE_ORDER` + `BuilderStage` type. Folds all 17 phase ids into the 6 canonical stages (+ `unknown`). Pure, generic, vscode-free.
- `packages/core/src/index.ts` (or the package's export map) — export the new module so VSCode can import `@cluesmith/codev-core/phase-grouping` (mirror how `area-grouping` is exported). *Verify the actual export mechanism before editing — package.json `exports` map vs. barrel file.*
- `packages/vscode/src/views/builders.ts` — `groupByArea`→`groupByStage` at lines 147 & 179; `rowsForGroup(stage)`; group-item construction with `g.stage`; remove the Uncategorized-flatten branch (153-156); new storage key `codev.buildersStageGroupExpansion` (line 86); update class-level JSDoc (55-69) to describe stage-grouping.
- `packages/vscode/src/views/builder-row.ts:149-160` — `builderRowLabel`: `phasePrefix`→`areaPrefix`; import `UNCATEGORIZED_AREA`; rewrite JSDoc (124-148).
- `packages/vscode/src/views/builder-tree-item.ts:43-55` — clarifying comment that `BuilderGroupTreeItem`'s `areaName` slot now carries a stage; rename "area-group" prose/JSDoc → "stage-group" (27-55). Header rollup-icon behavior unchanged (design call #7).
- `packages/core/src/__tests__/phase-grouping.test.ts` (or wherever core unit tests live) — **new** tests for `groupByStage` / `PHASE_TO_STAGE`.
- `packages/vscode/src/__tests__/builder-row.test.ts` — update `builderRowLabel` expectations (phase-prefix → area-prefix) and add area-prefix cases (labeled / Uncategorized-omitted / cross-cutting).

## Risks & Alternatives Considered

- **Risk: `protocolPhase` empty/transient state.** Mitigation: the `unknown` sentinel bucket gives those builders a stable trailing home rather than dropping them. Acceptance criterion "builder counts per group are accurate" still holds because every builder lands in exactly one bucket.
- **Risk: `pr`/`verified` builders linger in the tree.** They render in `PR`/`VERIFIED` groups until `afx cleanup` removes the worktree — which matches today's behavior (they show under their area group now). No regression; arguably clearer.
- **Risk: removing the flatten branch changes the unlabeled-repo experience.** For unlabeled repos, today's tree is flat (no headers); after this change a single-builder unlabeled repo sees an `IMPLEMENT (1)` header. This is intentional — phase is the point of the view. Called out so the reviewer expects it at the dev-approval gate.
- **Behavior change (NEW): rows relocate between sections over a builder's life.** Under area-grouping the group key (`area/*`) is *static*, so rows never moved between groups — only the in-place `[<phase>]` text changed. Stage is *time-varying*, so a builder advancing PLAN→IMPLEMENT→… now **jumps** to the new section on the next SSE refresh (VSCode `TreeView` has no node-move animation — it's a discrete re-render, not a slide). Mitigations/notes: (a) the row's stable `item.id` (builder id) lets VSCode reconcile it as the same item, preserving its expanded changed-files sublist and selection across the move; (b) empty-group-hiding means whole headers blink in/out at low counts (`PLAN (1)` disappears, `IMPLEMENT (1)` appears) — more visible than an in-list shift; (c) if the destination stage was collapsed by the user, the advancing builder moves into a folded section and isn't visible until expanded. Frequency is low (phase transitions are rare per builder; gated phases sit still), so motion is occasional and meaningful, not churn. Accepted as inherent to the action axis — flagged for the dev-approval walkthrough.
- **Alternative: synthetic `BLOCKED` group** (rejected, design call #4) — would double-encode the state already carried by icon color and split a phase's builders across two groups.
- **Alternative: rename `AreaGroupTreeItem`/`areaName` to generic `groupKey`** (rejected) — cleaner naming but sprawls into Backlog + base + tests for no behavioral gain; the issue explicitly endorses reusing the slot. Surgical scope preferred.
- **Alternative: keep alphabetical phase order** (rejected, design call #1) — `IMPLEMENT, PLAN, PR, REVIEW, SPECIFY, VERIFIED` is nonsensical for lifecycle triage.

## Test Plan

- **Unit (core `groupByStage` / `PHASE_TO_STAGE`)**:
  - stages returned in fixed `specify → plan → implement → review → pr → verified` order regardless of input order;
  - every phase id maps to the expected stage: assert each of the 17 ids resolves to its `PHASE_TO_STAGE` bucket (e.g. `hypothesis,scope → specify`; `design,investigate → plan`; `fix,execute,maintain,spike → implement`; `synthesize,analyze,critique → review`);
  - `investigate → plan` specifically (the architect-confirmed ambiguous call);
  - `verify`, `verified`, `complete` all fold into the single `verified` stage;
  - an unrecognized future phase (e.g. `frobnicate`) → `unknown`, NOT its own group;
  - empty stages omitted (a stage with no members produces no group);
  - empty-string `protocolPhase` → `unknown` stage, last;
  - within-stage input order preserved (display-order sort already applied upstream).
- **Unit (`builderRowLabel`)**:
  - labeled area → `[vscode] #882 title`;
  - `Uncategorized` → prefix omitted (`#882 title`);
  - `cross-cutting` → `[cross-cutting] #882 title`;
  - blocked/idle state suffix still appended after the title.
- **Manual / running-worktree (dev-approval gate — PIR's killer move)**:
  - `afx dev pir-952` to run the worktree's VSCode build (or load the extension), with several builders live across different phases.
  - Confirm the Builders tree groups by stage, headers in fixed lifecycle order, empty stages hidden, counts accurate.
  - Confirm each row reads `[<area>] #<id> <title>`; Uncategorized rows have no prefix.
  - Confirm a builder sitting at `plan-approval` appears under `PLAN` with the yellow `checklist` icon (state-color preserved).
  - Confirm Backlog tree still groups by area (no regression).
  - Confirm group collapse/expand persists across a window reload (new storage key).
- **Build/typecheck**: `pnpm --filter @cluesmith/codev-core build` then `pnpm --filter @cluesmith/codev build` (no `check-types` script in vscode — full build is the typecheck); run the vitest unit suites.

## Toggle addendum — dual-axis grouping (stage | area)

Layered on top of the stage-grouping swap: the Builders view's grouping axis is now switchable, defaulting to `stage`.

### Behavior
- **`codev.buildersGroupBy`** setting, enum `'stage' | 'area'`, default `'stage'`.
- Title-bar toggle button (mirrors the `buildersFileViewAsTree` house pattern): shows **"Group Builders by Area"** (`$(tag)`) when in stage mode, **"Group Builders by Phase"** (`$(list-ordered)`) when in area mode. Click flips the setting → context key updates → provider refreshes → tree re-groups.
- **The row prefix flips with the mode** (the group header carries one axis, the prefix the complementary one):
  - stage mode → groups are stages, prefix is `[<area>]` (Uncategorized omitted).
  - area mode → groups are `area/*`, prefix is `[<phase>]` (the original #810 form; empty phase omitted).
- **Area mode** keeps the single-`Uncategorized` flatten (zero regression for unlabeled repos); **stage mode** never flattens.
- **Per-axis expansion state**: stage mode persists under `codev.buildersStageGroupExpansion`, area mode under the original `codev.buildersGroupExpansion` (so pre-#952 area collapse state survives). A stable mode-routing wrapper (`GroupExpansionStore` interface) hands `persistAreaGroupExpansion` the active store at event time.

### Structure — `BuilderGrouping` strategy (not flag-branching)

The per-axis behavior is expressed as one strategy interface with two instances, so the provider never branches on the mode (the four things that vary per axis travel together and can't drift):

```ts
interface BuilderGrouping {
  readonly id: BuildersGroupBy;                              // 'stage' | 'area'
  group(ordered: OverviewBuilder[]): { key: string; items: OverviewBuilder[] }[];
  readonly expansion: GroupExpansionStore;                   // own workspaceState key
  rowPrefix(b: OverviewBuilder): string;                     // complementary-axis prefix
  readonly flattenLoneUncategorized: boolean;                // area: true, stage: false
}
```

`BuildersProvider` holds `Record<BuildersGroupBy, BuilderGrouping>` and an `active()` accessor (reads the setting); `rootChildren`/`rowsForGroup`/`makeBuilderRow` all delegate to `active()`. Adding an axis = one more strategy object.

### Files (beyond the swap)
- `packages/vscode/src/views/builder-grouping.ts` — **new**. `BuilderGrouping` interface + `BuildersGroupBy` type + `stageGrouping()` / `areaGrouping()` factories. Pure / vscode-free (type-only `GroupExpansionStore` import) → unit-testable.
- `packages/vscode/src/views/area-group-expansion.ts` — extract `GroupExpansionStore` interface; `AreaGroupExpansionStore implements` it; `persistAreaGroupExpansion` accepts the interface.
- `packages/vscode/src/views/area-group-tree-item.ts` + `builder-tree-item.ts` — rename the shared group-key field `areaName` → `groupName` (honest: it's an area for Backlog, an area-or-stage for Builders); the tree item is axis-agnostic.
- `packages/vscode/src/views/builder-row.ts` — `builderRowLabel(b, isIdle, now, prefix)` is now a pure formatter; the prefix (area vs phase) is supplied by the active strategy, not selected here.
- `packages/vscode/src/views/builders.ts` — `active()` returns the strategy; `groupParentByBuilderId`/flatten/expansion/rowPrefix all go through it; reads `element.groupName`.
- `packages/vscode/src/views/backlog.ts` — reads `element.groupName` (field rename only; backlog stays area-grouped).
- `packages/vscode/src/extension.ts` — context-key mirror + `codev.groupBuildersByArea` / `codev.groupBuildersByPhase` command handlers.
- `packages/vscode/package.json` — `codev.buildersGroupBy` config, two commands, two `view/title` menus gated on the context key.
- `packages/vscode/src/__tests__/builder-grouping.test.ts` (**new**, strategy coverage) + `builder-row.test.ts` (row label as pure prefix formatter).

### Acceptance criteria delta (toggle)
- **ADDED**: Builders view groups by `stage` (default) or `area`, switchable via a title-bar toggle (`codev.buildersGroupBy`); the row prefix is the complementary axis in each mode; per-axis collapse state is independent; area mode preserves the unlabeled-repo flatten. All prior criteria still hold for the default (stage) mode.
