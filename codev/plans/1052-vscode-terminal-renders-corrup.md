# PIR Plan: Force a TUI redraw on VSCode window reactivation

## Understanding

When a Codev terminal pane (architect or builder, backed by the shellper PTY relayed
through Tower) is left while the VSCode window loses focus (alt-tab, lock screen, monitor
switch) and the user returns, the pane renders corrupted: stacked/overlapping TUI frames
and the cursor landing near the top of the pane instead of in the prompt area. The only
workarounds are disruptive (resize the window, clear, or reopen the tab).

**Root cause (the actionable one).** VSCode's terminal renderer (xterm.js) can drift out
of sync with the PTY's actual screen/cursor state across a window-focus transition — the
WebView is throttled while hidden, output accumulates, and on reactivation the rendered
state no longer matches what the TUI app believes it drew. The decisive observation is in
the issue itself: **resizing the window clears the corruption**. A window resize forces a
SIGWINCH, which makes the full-screen TUI (Claude Code's UI) clear and repaint its entire
alt-screen — re-emitting a complete frame whose trailing cursor-move sequence re-syncs
xterm.js's cursor. So the corruption is recoverable by a single forced redraw; the bug is
that nothing triggers that redraw automatically on refocus.

**Why the existing code doesn't cover it.** PR #1050 (#1047) added a post-connect repaint
nudge to `CodevPseudoterminal` for the blank-on-open case:

- `packages/vscode/src/terminal-adapter.ts:410-424` — `scheduleRepaintNudge()` sends a
  `rows-1 → rows` size delta ~500ms after a WS connect to guarantee a real `TIOCSWINSZ`
  delta (hence a SIGWINCH), but **only if `renderedSinceConnect` is still false**
  (`terminal-adapter.ts:414`) and **only on connect** (`open`/reconnect path, scheduled
  from the WS `open` handler at `terminal-adapter.ts:193-194`).

A pure window refocus is **not a reconnect** — the WebSocket stays open, so the nudge
never schedules; and even if it did, `renderedSinceConnect` is already `true` (the pane
rendered long ago), so the gate would suppress it. There is no window-reactivation hook
anywhere in `packages/vscode/` (confirmed: no `onDidChangeWindowState` usage exists).

**The dashboard already solves the web-equivalent.** The browser terminal handles the
analogous "tab became visible again" case:
`packages/dashboard/src/components/Terminal.tsx:740-744` re-fits and SIGWINCHs on the
DOM `visibilitychange` event. The VSCode adapter simply lacks the parallel handler for
`onDidChangeWindowState`. This plan ports that proven pattern to VSCode.

## Proposed Change

Reuse the existing, proven SIGWINCH-redraw lever and add **window reactivation** as a new
trigger for it.

1. **Adapter: expose a public `forceRepaint()`** on `CodevPseudoterminal`
   (`terminal-adapter.ts`). Refactor the size-delta logic currently inlined in the
   `scheduleRepaintNudge` timer body (`terminal-adapter.ts:415-422`) into a private
   `forceSigwinchRedraw()` helper, and call it from both:
   - the existing nudge timer (unchanged behavior — still gated on
     `!renderedSinceConnect`), and
   - the new public `forceRepaint()`, which is **ungated** by `renderedSinceConnect`
     (by definition the pane has already rendered on a refocus).

   `forceRepaint()` no-ops when: `disposed`, the socket is not OPEN, `replaying` is true
   (a connect-time replay is in flight; the connect path owns the redraw then), or
   `lastDimensions` is null. When `rows <= 1`, send a plain resize at the current size
   (mirrors the existing edge-case branch at `terminal-adapter.ts:417`).

2. **Manager: add `repaintAllOnRefocus()`** on `TerminalManager`
   (`terminal-manager.ts`). Iterate the (≤ `MAX_TERMINALS`) managed terminals and call
   `pty.forceRepaint()` on each. Nudging all managed Codev PTYs (not just the active one)
   covers the common architect-in-group-1 + builder-in-group-2 dual-pane layout where
   both panes can be corrupted on refocus. A SIGWINCH to a non-TUI shell is visually
   inert, so the blast radius on healthy terminals is nil.

3. **Extension: wire `onDidChangeWindowState`** in `extension.ts`'s `activate()`
   (alongside the existing `onDidChangeActiveTerminal` registration at
   `extension.ts:189-190`). Track the previous `focused` value and call
   `terminalManager.repaintAllOnRefocus()` **only on the rising edge**
   (unfocused → focused), so blur events and redundant focused-stays-true notifications
   don't fire spurious nudges. Register the disposable in `context.subscriptions`.

### Flow after the change
Window regains focus → `onDidChangeWindowState({ focused: true })` rising edge →
`terminalManager.repaintAllOnRefocus()` → each `pty.forceRepaint()` → `rows-1 → rows`
resize control frames → Tower relays to PTY → SIGWINCH → TUI clears + repaints full frame
→ xterm.js display fully overwritten, cursor re-synced. Identical end state to the manual
"resize the window" workaround, performed automatically.

## Files to Change

- `packages/vscode/src/terminal-adapter.ts`
  - Extract `forceSigwinchRedraw()` private helper from the `scheduleRepaintNudge` timer
    body (`:415-422`); have the timer call it.
  - Add public `forceRepaint()` (`:~424`) — guards (disposed / not OPEN / replaying /
    no dimensions) then `forceSigwinchRedraw()`.
- `packages/vscode/src/terminal-manager.ts`
  - Add `repaintAllOnRefocus()` — iterate `this.terminals`, call `entry.pty.forceRepaint()`.
- `packages/vscode/src/extension.ts`
  - In `activate()` near `:189`, register `vscode.window.onDidChangeWindowState` with a
    rising-edge guard calling `terminalManager.repaintAllOnRefocus()`; push the disposable
    into `context.subscriptions`.
- `packages/vscode/src/__tests__/terminal-adapter.test.ts`
  - New tests for `forceRepaint()` (see Test Plan).
- `packages/vscode/src/__tests__/terminal-manager.test.ts`
  - New test: `repaintAllOnRefocus()` calls `forceRepaint` on every managed pty.
- `packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md` + `docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md`
  - User-facing entry: terminal auto-redraws on window refocus, fixing post-focus
    corruption / cursor-at-top.

**Scope note:** VSCode-only (`area/vscode`). No Tower/shellper/skeleton changes — the PTY
content reaching Tower is already correct (per the issue's "out of scope"); the fix is
purely in the VSCode renderer-adapter layer. The `resize` control frame and SIGWINCH
plumbing already exist and are unchanged.

## Risks & Alternatives Considered

- **Risk: redraw flicker on every refocus.** The `rows-1 → rows` dance shows a 1-row-short
  frame for an instant. The existing connect-time nudge already accepts this; for a
  full-screen TUI the redraw is instant and clean. Mitigation: rising-edge-only firing
  (no repeats while focused), and the brief intermediate frame is immediately overwritten
  by the final-size repaint.
- **Risk: nudging healthy/non-TUI terminals.** A SIGWINCH is a no-op for a shell not
  running a TUI; for a TUI it produces exactly the desired clean redraw. Net cost ≈ one
  small control frame per managed terminal per refocus (≤10 frames). Acceptable.
- **Risk: this doesn't fully fix a deeper xterm.js parser-state corruption (issue
  mechanism #4).** If a partial ANSI sequence was dropped mid-frame leaving xterm's parser
  wedged, a SIGWINCH redraw from the app still feeds fresh, complete sequences and
  visually recovers — matching the manual workaround. If the `dev-approval` gate shows a
  residual case the SIGWINCH can't clear, escalate; a heavier `forceRepaint()` mode could
  reconnect-with-replay (the dashboard refresh-button's "full refresh" mode,
  `Terminal.tsx:40-42`) as a follow-up. Kept out of scope here to stay minimal.
- **Alternative: fire the nudge on `onDidChangeActiveTerminal` instead.** Rejected — that
  fires on tab switches within an already-focused window (over-firing) and not reliably on
  OS-level window refocus, which is the actual repro trigger.
- **Alternative: per-terminal visibility (`Terminal.state`/active-only).** Rejected as
  more complex and less robust than nudging all managed PTYs, which is cheap and covers
  multi-pane layouts. Can be tightened later if churn is observed.
- **Alternative: debounce window-state events.** The rising-edge guard already collapses
  the chatter; a timer adds latency to the very redraw we want immediate. Rejected.

## Test Plan

### Unit (`pnpm --filter @cluesmith/codev test`, plus the vscode adapter/manager suites)
- `terminal-adapter.test.ts` — new `describe('PIR #1052 — forceRepaint on window refocus')`:
  - `forceRepaint()` sends a `rows-1 → rows` resize delta when the socket is OPEN and
    dimensions are known (assert via the existing `sentResizes()` helper), **even though
    `renderedSinceConnect` is already true** (drive output first, then call).
  - No-ops (emits no resize) when: disposed, socket not OPEN, mid-replay (`pause` seen,
    no `resume`), or no dimensions.
- `terminal-manager.test.ts` — new test: `repaintAllOnRefocus()` invokes `forceRepaint`
  on every registered managed pty (spy on the adapter method).

### Manual — the load-bearing `dev-approval` check (real VSCode, cannot be a diff read)
Reviewer runs the worktree build in VSCode (Run Dev Server / `afx dev pir-1052`, then open
a Codev terminal):
1. Open the architect terminal with Claude's full-screen TUI rendered normally.
2. Switch focus away from the VSCode window (alt-tab / lock / different monitor); wait
   several seconds so background accumulation/throttling occurs.
3. Return focus to the VSCode window, click into the pane, type a character.
4. **Expect:** the pane is clean (no stacked INSERT/status lines) and the character lands
   in the prompt area at the bottom — not near the top. Confirm without any manual resize.
5. Repeat for a **builder** terminal (same code path) to confirm both panes are covered.
6. Sanity: a non-TUI shell terminal and an already-focused window (no blur) show no
   disruption / no spurious redraw.
