# PIR Plan: Removed sibling architect resurrects after Tower recovery

Issue: #1150

## Understanding

`afx workspace remove-architect --name X` kills the sibling's terminal and deletes two DB rows: the `architect` row (via `setArchitectByName(resolvedPath, name, null)`) and the `terminal_sessions` row. Both deletes are wrapped in silent `try { … } catch { /* best-effort cleanup */ }` at `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/servers/tower-instances.ts:1168-1174`. If either delete fails (SQLITE_BUSY past the 5s timeout, IO error), the user still sees "Removed architect 'X'".

Separately, `launchInstance`'s sibling reconciliation loop (`tower-instances.ts:681-693`) reads `getArchitects(resolvedPath)` and unconditionally calls `addArchitect()` for every non-main row not already live in `entry.architects`. `addArchitect` reads the row's stored `session_id` and resumes the old conversation via the harness `session.resumeArgs()` (`--resume` for Claude). There is no liveness check: any residual `architect` row resurrects the sibling on the next workspace launch.

### Interaction with #1145 (merged 2026-07-11, this branch is rebased on it)

PR #1160 (Issue #1145) added session **ownership verification** to every architect resume path: `resolveArchitectLaunch` now resumes a stored id only when `harness.session.verifyOwnership()` confirms the jsonl still exists on disk (`verifySessionOwnership` in `utils/claude-session-discovery.ts`, symlink-safe via dual path encoding). A stale id degrades to a fresh spawn, whose newly minted id then replaces the stored one.

Consequences for this issue:

- The **crash-loop symptom** (RC2, broken `--resume` baked into a shellper restart loop) is already fixed at resume time.
- The **resurrection itself is not fixed**: the reconcile loop still respawns every persisted row. A dead registration with a stale id now respawns *fresh*, and its fresh id is persisted, so the zombie self-heals into a legitimate-looking registration on every launch. Pruning at the reconcile loop remains the correct fix for #1150.
- This plan **reuses** #1145's primitives instead of adding new ones: the originally planned `sessionFileExists()` / `session.sessionExists?()` are already there as `verifySessionOwnership()` / `session.verifyOwnership?()`. No new harness surface is needed.

### Where residual rows actually come from (probability-ordered)

Plan-review finding (2026-07-11): the issue's root-cause analysis listed swallowed delete failures and WAL loss, but the most probable source of the 2026-07-08 reports is the Issue #1118 consolidation, which shipped ~one week earlier (PR #1127, ~2026-07-01):

1. **#1118 consolidation re-inserting stale snapshot rows (deterministic, most likely).** Pre-#1118, `getDb()` opened a per-workspace `state.db` chosen by Tower's start cwd, not by the workspace being operated on. A `remove-architect` could therefore delete from the wrong file, leaving the real row alive in another workspace's `state.db`. The #1118 cutover then merges those stale files into `global.db`: the boot one-off (`db/consolidate.ts:runBootConsolidation`) plus the user-driven satellite sweep the release notes prescribe (`afx db consolidate <path> --apply`). `upsertArchitect` (`consolidate.ts:195-205`) is upsert-if-newer, which only guards against stale overwrites of existing rows; a removed architect has no `global.db` row at all, so its stale snapshot row classifies as "inserted" and comes back, carrying an old `session_id`. This vector self-extinguishes (each consolidated source is renamed to `*.pre-merge-*` and never re-read), but the fleet is mid-transition right now.
2. **WAL durability loss at OS-crash time (low probability).** `synchronous = NORMAL` in WAL mode means a commit is acknowledged before fsync; a power loss or kernel panic within the OS write-back window (seconds) can roll back a committed removal.
3. **Silent DB write failure in `removeArchitect` (lowest probability, still a real defect).** SQLITE_BUSY past the 5s timeout or an IO error is swallowed by the catch, and the user sees "Removed" anyway. Rare because Tower is effectively the sole steady-state writer, but wrong in kind: the delete is the operation, not optional cleanup.

The reconcile loop's blind trust is the amplifier common to all three. That is why the fix gates consumption (Part 2) and makes removal loud and retryable (Part 1) rather than only hardening any single injection path.

Relevant context confirmed during investigation:

- Boot order: `reconcileTerminalSessions()` runs before `initInstances()` (`tower-server.ts:454`). Its Phase 2 sweep (`tower-terminals.ts:807-825`) deletes every `terminal_sessions` row whose shellper is dead. So after a machine crash, legitimate siblings have NO `terminal_sessions` row by the time `launchInstance` runs; their only liveness evidence is the conversation jsonl on disk (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session_id>.jsonl`, helpers in `utils/claude-session-discovery.ts`).
- After a clean `afx workspace stop`, the architect exit handlers delete `terminal_sessions` rows unconditionally (e.g. `tower-instances.ts:1020`) while the `architect` rows are preserved via the `intentionallyStopping` flag. Sibling persistence across stop/start (Spec 786 Phase 3) therefore relies solely on `architect` rows. Any liveness gate must not break this.
- Harnesses without the `session` capability (Codex, Gemini: `utils/harness.ts:138-158`) never store a `session_id`. Their rows can never have jsonl evidence, and their respawn is always a fresh spawn (no `--resume`), so pruning them on the strict "terminal_sessions row OR jsonl" rule would silently regress Spec 786 stop/start persistence for non-Claude architects while buying nothing (no conversation can resurrect).

## Proposed Change

Three parts, matching the issue's fix sketch with one deliberate refinement for session-less harnesses.

### Part 1: `removeArchitect` surfaces DB delete failures and becomes retryable

`tower-instances.ts:1151-1186`:

1. Replace the two silent catches with error collection. If either `setArchitectByName(..., null)` or `deleteTerminalSession(terminalId)` throws, still await the exit promise (terminal cleanup proceeds), then return `{ success: false, error: "Architect 'X' terminal was stopped, but deleting its registration failed (<cause>). Its record may resurrect on the next workspace start. Run 'afx workspace remove-architect --name X' again to retry." }`.
2. Make the retry actually work: today a retry after a partial removal hits the `entry.architects.get(name)` miss and returns "not found", even though the zombie row is exactly what needs deleting. In the not-found branch, check `getArchitectByName(resolvedPath, name)`; if a persisted row exists, delete it (plus any architect `terminal_sessions` rows keyed by `(workspace, role_id = name)`), log, and return success. This doubles as the user-facing purge tool for zombie registrations regardless of how they arose.

### Part 2: liveness gate in the sibling reconcile loop

`tower-instances.ts:681-693`: before `addArchitect()`, classify each persisted row:

1. **Live**: a `terminal_sessions` row exists for `(workspace_path IN (resolvedPath, workspacePath), type = 'architect', role_id = name)`. Query via `getGlobalDb()` (already imported).
2. **Live**: the resolved architect harness has no `session` capability. Rationale: the row can never carry resumable-session evidence, respawn is always fresh (no `--resume`, no conversation resurrection), and pruning would break Spec 786 stop/start persistence for Codex/Gemini architects.
3. **Live**: the row has a `session_id` and the harness confirms the session artifact exists on disk, via #1145's `session.verifyOwnership?()` (Claude implements it with `verifySessionOwnership()`, which is already symlink-safe across both path encodings). A session-capable harness that omits `verifyOwnership` is treated as unverifiable, hence live (never prune without positive evidence of staleness; mirrors `sessionIsOwned`'s trust default in `tower-utils.ts:198`).
4. **Dead** otherwise (session-capable harness with no `session_id`, or a `session_id` whose jsonl is gone): prune with `setArchitectByName(resolvedPath, name, null)` inside its own try/catch, log at INFO ("Pruned dead sibling architect registration 'X': no live terminal and no resumable session"), and skip the respawn.

Placement: a small exported helper in `tower-utils.ts` next to `sessionIsOwned` (e.g. `siblingSessionIsResumable(workspacePath, name, sessionId, opts?)`), so harness resolution stays in tower-utils (#1145 removed the `getArchitectHarness` import from tower-instances.ts; no need to reintroduce it). `sessionIsOwned` itself stays private; the new helper wraps the same verify call with the no-capability / no-id distinction rules 2-4 need.

No harness or discovery changes required: #1145 already shipped `verifySessionOwnership()` and `session.verifyOwnership?()`, including the `homeDir` test seam.

Behavior note (deviation from the issue's strict OR rule, called out for review): a legacy pre-#832 Claude-harness row with `session_id = NULL` and no `terminal_sessions` row is pruned (rule 4). That is a one-time migration edge; the user re-adds the sibling once. Session-less harnesses are exempted (rule 2) for the reasons above.

### Part 3 (defense in depth): `synchronous = FULL`

`db/index.ts:40`: switch the pragma from `NORMAL` to `FULL` in `configurePragmas`, with a comment explaining the WAL-loss window this closes (committed transactions lost at power loss under NORMAL). The pragma is per-connection and the shared `global.db` connection has a low write rate (spawn/exit/status events), so the extra fsync per commit is negligible. Toggling the pragma around architect writes only was rejected: it is racy on a shared connection and buys nothing at this write rate.

## Files to Change

- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/servers/tower-instances.ts:1137-1140` — not-found branch: purge zombie row if a persisted registration exists
- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/servers/tower-instances.ts:1165-1186` — surface DB delete failures from `removeArchitect`
- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/servers/tower-instances.ts:681-693` — liveness gate + prune in the sibling reconcile loop
- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/servers/tower-utils.ts` — exported liveness helper next to `sessionIsOwned` (reuses #1145's `session.verifyOwnership?()`; no harness/discovery changes needed)
- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/db/index.ts:40` — `synchronous = FULL`
- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/__tests__/tower-instances.test.ts` — new tests (below)
- `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/__tests__/tower-utils.test.ts` — liveness helper tests (builds on #1145's `homeDir` seam)

No skeleton mirror needed: all touched files are package source, not framework docs.

## Risks & Alternatives Considered

- **Known gap (stated honestly): the liveness gate does not stop a resurrected row whose jsonl still exists.** A consolidation-re-inserted row for a recently-active removed architect passes rule 3 (its conversation jsonl is still on disk) and resurrects. For these, Part 1's retryable purge is the user-facing remedy, and the vector itself is transitional (consolidated sources are renamed and never re-read). An alternative, having `removeArchitect` also delete the conversation jsonl so no future resurrection can ever resume it, was considered and left out: it permanently destroys the user's transcript, and #832 deliberately dropped jsonl pruning from removal (`tower-instances.ts:1177-1178`). Reviewer may reinstate it if the tradeoff reads differently.
- **Residual window (documented, not fully closable)**: if a removal commits and the OS then crashes before the WAL is fsync'd, the deletes are lost and the row returns with a valid `session_id` and existing jsonl. No liveness check can distinguish this from a legitimate sibling. Part 3 (`synchronous = FULL`) is the mitigation; Part 1's retryable purge is the recovery path.
- **Out of scope, flagged for a possible follow-up issue: consolidation has no tombstone concept.** `afx db consolidate` of any stale source re-inserts rows deleted from `global.db` since the snapshot. Fixing that generally (tombstones, or skipping sibling architect rows during merge) is a design decision beyond this issue; the liveness gate plus retryable purge contain the damage for architects specifically.
- **Risk: pruning a legitimate sibling.** Mitigations: rule 2 exempts session-less harnesses; rule 3 checks both path encodings; jsonl files survive `afx workspace stop` so Spec 786 persistence is intact for Claude architects. The worst case of a wrong prune is "user re-adds the sibling", vs. the current worst case of "removed architect resurrects with its old conversation" (the crash-loop half of the old worst case is already fixed by #1145).
- **Risk: `synchronous = FULL` slows writes.** Write rate on global.db is low (lifecycle events, not hot-path). Accepted.
- **Alternative rejected: strict "terminal_sessions row OR jsonl" gate exactly as sketched.** Regresses Spec 786 stop/start persistence for Codex/Gemini siblings (their rows never carry a session_id and their terminal_sessions rows are deleted on every clean stop), while the danger the gate targets (conversation resurrection via `--resume`) cannot occur for them.
- **Alternative rejected: tombstone table for removed architects.** A tombstone write is lost in exactly the same WAL-loss window as the delete it guards, so it adds schema for no additional durability.

## Test Plan

Unit tests (vitest, existing mock harness in `tower-instances.test.ts` already stubs the DB via `mockDbPrepare` and deps via `makeDeps()`):

- `removeArchitect`: make `setArchitectByName` (DB `run`) throw; expect `{ success: false }` with an error naming the architect and advising a retry; expect the terminal kill still happened.
- `removeArchitect`: name absent from `entry.architects` but `getArchitectByName` returns a row; expect the row purged and `{ success: true }`.
- Reconcile loop: persisted sibling row, no `terminal_sessions` row, Claude harness, `session_id` set but jsonl missing; expect prune (`DELETE FROM architect` issued for that name) and no spawn.
- Reconcile loop: same but jsonl present (via #1145's `homeDir` seam, real file under a temp home, as `tower-utils.test.ts` already does for `verifySessionOwnership`); expect respawn attempt.
- Reconcile loop: matching `terminal_sessions` row; expect respawn attempt without consulting jsonl.
- Reconcile loop: session-less harness (Codex) row with `session_id = NULL`; expect respawn (fresh), not prune.
- Liveness helper unit tests in `tower-utils.test.ts` (no new discovery tests needed; `verifySessionOwnership` is already covered by #1145's suite).

Build + full test suite from the worktree: `pnpm --filter @cluesmith/codev build && pnpm --filter @cluesmith/codev test`.

Manual verification at the dev-approval gate (commands for the reviewer; they mutate the live Tower DB so the reviewer runs them):

1. Insert a fake dead registration into `~/.agent-farm/global.db`:
   `sqlite3 ~/.agent-farm/global.db "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO architect (workspace_path, id, pid, port, cmd, started_at, terminal_id, session_id) VALUES ('<workspace>', 'ghost', 0, 0, 'claude', datetime('now'), NULL, 'deadbeef-0000-0000-0000-000000000000')"`
2. Restart the workspace (`afx workspace stop` / `start`) with the locally installed build; observe the "Pruned dead sibling architect registration 'ghost'" log line and confirm no ghost architect appears in `afx status`.
3. Add a real sibling (`afx workspace add-architect --name tmp`), `afx workspace stop`, `afx workspace start`: confirm the sibling still resurrects with its conversation (Spec 786 persistence intact).
4. `afx workspace remove-architect --name tmp`, then stop/start again: confirm it stays gone.
