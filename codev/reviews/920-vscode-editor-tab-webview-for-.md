# PIR Review: VSCode editor-tab webview for rich backlog search

Fixes #920

## Summary

Adds a **"Search Backlog" editor-tab webview** to the VSCode extension for exploratory backlog triage — opened from a 🔍 icon in the Backlog view's title bar. The panel filters open issues by Area / Assignee / Author, substring-searches title **+ body**, sorts by column, and shows a match-count footer; rows open the issue or reference it in the architect chat. Data comes from a **dedicated `issue-search` forge concept** surfaced as `GET /api/issue-search` (kept separate from `issue-list` so the always-on `/api/overview` payload stays body-free). It complements the always-on sidebar tree and the #918 Quick Pick rather than replacing either (and supersedes the closed #906).

## Test Results

- `pnpm build` (types / core / codev): ✓ pass
- vscode: `check-types` ✓, `lint` ✓, `esbuild` bundle ✓, `test:unit` ✓ — **192 tests** (incl. ~20 new `searchBacklog`/`formatAge` cases)
- codev full suite: ✓ **3210 passed / 13 skipped** (the 13 skips + the `nonexistent_check` warnings are pre-existing on `main`, unrelated to this change)
- github `issue-search.sh` exercised live here: `state=open` → 93 issues with `body` present; `closed`/`all` → 200-capped, `body` present
- **Manual verification**: the human approved the `dev-approval` gate after reviewing the running worktree (the gate exists precisely for the theme/result-size/filter-combination checks a PR diff can't catch).

## Architecture Updates

Updated `codev/resources/arch.md` → **VS Code Extension › Key Design Decisions**: added an "Editor-tab webviews (#920)" entry documenting the reusable pattern (editor-area `WebviewPanel`, host-side filtering in vscode-free pure helpers so logic stays testable and issue bodies never reach the webview, `*.template.ts` markup with CSS-variables-only theming + nonce'd CSP, fed by the dedicated `issue-search` concept). Did **not** add `/api/issue-search` to the API table — that table covers Tower lifecycle/management endpoints and doesn't enumerate the overview/issue *data* reads (`/api/overview`, `/api/issue` aren't listed either), so adding it would be inconsistent.

## Lessons Learned Updates

Added two entries to `codev/resources/lessons-learned.md` → **Architecture**:
1. Prefer a **dedicated forge concept** over parameterizing a shared one when a feature needs extra data/queries — parameterizing couples the shared primitive and (here) would have silently returned wrong results on non-GitHub forges; a dedicated concept degrades honestly to "unavailable". Extends the #909 forge-agnostic-layer lesson.
2. **Name by layer**: route/concept/lib = resource (`issue-search`), UI = feature ("Search Backlog"); don't mix vocabularies across the same data path.

## Things to Look At During PR Review

- **The three unverified forge scripts** (`gitlab`/`gitea`/`linear` `issue-search.sh`). Only `github` was empirically exercised (this repo's forge). The others are faithful mirrors of their `issue-list.sh` siblings + `body` + a state mapping, each with a `⚠️ UNVERIFIED` header naming exactly what to smoke-test (glab's `--closed`/`--all`, tea's `--state`/`body` field, Linear's `state.type` filter). They degrade safely — a forge whose concept errors returns null → "search unavailable" — so they can't silently misbehave, but they need a smoke-test by someone with those CLIs before being trusted.
- **Status semantics**: `open` reproduces the sidebar's PR-excluded backlog; `closed`/`all` deliberately *lift* the PR-exclusion (a closed issue usually has a merged PR, so excluding would empty the list). Confirm that's the intended behavior.
- **Coexistence with #918**: both `codev.openBacklogSearch` (this panel) and `codev.searchBacklog` (Quick Pick) live in the tree now — verified only the panel is in the title bar (one 🔍); the Quick Pick is palette-only. Both appear in the command palette with near-adjacent titles ("Search Backlog" vs "Search Backlog…") — acceptable, but a candidate for a future title tweak.
- **`extension.ts` is tab-indented** (the file's pre-existing style, repo-wide outlier); edits matched it deliberately — not a conversion. No formatter exists in the repo.

## How to Test Locally

- **View diff**: VSCode sidebar → right-click builder `pir-920` → **View Diff**
- **Run it** (spans Tower + extension, so both must carry the branch):
  1. `cd .builders/pir-920 && pnpm -w run local-install` — rebuilds + restarts Tower so it serves `/api/issue-search` and resolves the `issue-search` concept.
  2. Open the worktree in VSCode → **F5** ("Run Codev Extension") → Extension Development Host.
  3. Codev sidebar → Backlog → **🔍** → "Search Backlog" tab.
- **What to verify** (from the plan's Test Plan): live debounced text search over title+body; Area/Assignee/Author scopes AND together; Status Open→Closed→All re-fetches; column-header sort with arrow indicator (default Age ▼ = oldest first); row click opens the issue; row `↪` references it in the architect chat; footer `N matches found · by-area breakdown`; re-invoking focuses the single instance; **theme sweep across dark / light / high-contrast** (CSS variables only).

## Flaky Tests

None skipped. (The 13 pre-existing skips in the codev suite are unrelated to this change and were not touched.)
