# Publish the VS Code extension to BOTH registries from a single packaged
# .vsix — keeps VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX byte-identical.
#
# Usage:
#   pnpm vscode:publish        # stable, both registries
#   pnpm vscode:publish:pre    # pre-release channel, both registries
#
# (Or invoke directly: `sh apps/vscode/scripts/publish.sh [--pre-release]`.)
#
# Auth:
#   VSCE_PAT  — VS Code Marketplace token, or run `vsce login cluesmith` once
#               (stored in OS keychain under service `vscode-vsce`)
#   OVSX_PAT  — Open VSX token. ovsx has no keychain support; export via shell rc
#               or pull from a secrets manager. See codev/protocols/release/protocol.md.
#
# Failure recovery:
#   Both registries reject duplicate-version uploads. If Marketplace succeeds
#   and Open VSX fails, the .vsix is still on disk — retry just the failed one:
#       ovsx publish apps/vscode/codev-vscode-X.Y.Z.vsix
#
# Why one script instead of two separate publishes:
#   Running `vsce publish` then `ovsx publish` would each rebuild + repackage,
#   producing two functionally-equivalent but byte-different .vsix files.
#   Packaging once guarantees both registries receive identical bytes.
