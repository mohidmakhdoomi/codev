/**
 * Pure, vscode-free resolution of a builder's live terminal from Tower's
 * workspace-state, with a bounded retry that absorbs the transient window in
 * which Tower's session registry disagrees with the sidebar (PIR #982).
 *
 * The sidebar lists a builder as soon as its worktree exists on disk
 * (`/api/overview`), but the terminal opener needs a *live* PTY session
 * (`/api/state`, which includes a builder only if `manager.getSession` resolves).
 * `/api/state` rehydrates and on-the-fly-reconnects shellper sessions on every
 * call, so a click that lands mid-rehydration, during Tower's startup
 * reconciliation, or in the spawn race sees the builder momentarily without a
 * live `terminalId` — and the very next call resolves it. Retrying a few times
 * with a short backoff lets that dominant, transient case heal silently instead
 * of dead-ending on the "No active terminal" warning. Only a genuinely
 * persistent miss (dead shellper, reaped session) falls through to `missing`.
 *
 * Kept vscode-free (deps injected) so it unit-tests under the vitest `__tests__/`
 * harness — mirroring `views/builder-row.ts` — rather than needing a full vscode
 * mock. The toast/recovery UX it feeds lives in `terminal-manager.ts`.
