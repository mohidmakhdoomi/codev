/**
 * Codev: Open Worktree as Workspace — opens a builder's worktree in a new
 * editor window. The new window is rooted at `.builders/<id>/`, so VSCode's
 * built-in Git extension treats it as a primary checkout: the SCM panel
 * shows working-tree changes, "View Working Tree Changes" shows committed
 * diff vs the default branch, and inline-editor diffs work natively.
 *
 * Replaces the previous "View Diff" command, which tried to render a
 * multi-file diff in the current window via `vscode.changes` + `git:` URIs
 * but couldn't, because VSCode's Git extension doesn't auto-discover
 * worktrees inside `.gitignore`d subdirectories of the host workspace.
 *
 * Editor-agnostic: `vscode.openFolder` is a built-in command exposed by
 * VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf, and other VSCode-family editors. No CLI
 * detection needed.
