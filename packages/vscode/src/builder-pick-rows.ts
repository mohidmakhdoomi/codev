/**
 * Shared row-builder for the two builder Quick Pick pickers that need both
 * the overview display fields (issue # + title) and a `getWorkspaceState`-only
 * runtime field — Open Builder Terminal (needs `terminalId`) and Send Message
 * (needs the canonical `Builder.id`). (Issue #925)
 *
 * The seven other builder pickers source rows from `client.getOverview`
 * (`OverviewBuilder`, which carries `issueId`/`issueTitle`/`phase`). These two
 * historically sourced from `client.getWorkspaceState` (`Builder`, which has
 * `terminalId`/`name` but NO `issueId`/`issueTitle`) and so rendered the bare
 * internal name. Neither endpoint alone has every field, so — mirroring
 * `run-worktree-dev.ts` — we take the overview as the display source and join
 * each row back to its workspace `Builder` via `resolveAgentName` (the two id
 * shapes differ, e.g. `pir-925` vs `builder-pir-925`, so a tail-match join is
 * required rather than strict `===`).
 *
 * Pure and dependency-light so it can be unit-tested without a live Tower,
 * following the `prune-builder-terminals.ts` precedent.
