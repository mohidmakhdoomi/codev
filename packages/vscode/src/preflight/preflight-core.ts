 *                   but Tower is still on old in-memory code. Prompt a restart.
 * - `too-old`     — the probe returned 404: this Tower predates the
 *                   `/api/version` endpoint entirely. Prompt a restart, with
 *                   stronger wording.
 * - `unreachable` — the probe could not reach Tower. Defer to the existing
 *                   "not connected to Tower" path; no new signal.
