/**
 * Codev: Open Issue by ID — open a specific issue by typing its id, without
 * first finding it in the backlog Quick Pick.
 *
 * Bound to `Cmd+K I` / `Ctrl+K I`. This is the *browser* counterpart to the
 * backlog/`View Issue` family: where those render a read-only preview inside
 * VSCode, "Open Issue by ID" opens the issue's canonical forge page in the
 * external browser. That split is the command's reason to exist — direct,
 * keyboard-driven access to any issue (open, closed, archived, or one already
 * claimed by a builder and therefore filtered out of the backlog), fetched live
 * by id rather than picked from the loaded backlog set.
 *
 * "ID" rather than "number": the term is forge-neutral (GitLab `iid`, Linear /
 * Jira identifiers aren't bare numbers), matching the extension's existing
 * `issueId` vocabulary. The numeric validation in `parseIssueId` is the
 * GitHub-specific part; only it loosens if a non-numeric forge is supported.
 *
 * Graceful degradation: the issue is fetched via the same forge-agnostic
 * `getIssue` path the in-editor preview uses. When the forge supplies a `url`
 * (GitHub does), we open the browser; when it doesn't, we fall back to the
 * in-editor preview (`codev.viewBacklogIssue`) rather than failing.

 * malformed input (`""`, `"abc"`, `"12a3"`, `"#"`, `"##12"`).
 *
 * Pure (no `vscode` dependency) so it is unit-testable in isolation and reusable
