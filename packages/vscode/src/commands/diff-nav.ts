/**
 * Cross-file navigation in a Codev diff review (#1060).
 *
 * `codev.diffNextFile` / `codev.diffPreviousFile` walk a builder's changed-file
 * list top-to-bottom, opening each file's per-file diff — the keyboard
 * equivalent of clicking the next file row in the Builders sidebar (GitHub PR
 * review's `j` / `k`).
 *
 * The mechanic reuses already-shipped pieces rather than VS Code multi-diff
 * internals:
 *   - The ordered list comes from `BuilderDiffCache.getDiff` — the same source
 *     (and 15s TTL cache) that backs the sidebar's changed-file rows, in
 *     `git diff --name-status` order.
 *   - The current position is read from the active editor via the diff-inject
 *     registry (`getDiffInjectEntry`), which both View Diff and the per-file
 *     diff already populate with `{ builderId, relPath }`. So "where am I" is
 *     just the file the diff editor is showing — no stored pointer to drift.
 *   - The target file opens through the shared `openBuilderFileDiff` helper,
 *     with `{ preview: true }` so a walk reuses one tab.
 *
 * A module-level "last navigated position" is the only retained state — a
 * fallback for when the active editor isn't a tracked diff file (e.g. the user
 * focused a terminal between keypresses).
