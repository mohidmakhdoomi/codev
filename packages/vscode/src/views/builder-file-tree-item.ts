 * needs (it receives the item itself, like the backlog/builder rows, and
 * narrows via `instanceof`).
 *
 * `plan` (left/right `SideSpec`) feeds `diffUrisForChange`; `change`
 * carries the git status (used for the tooltip + rename source). The
 * status *icon* is deliberately NOT set here — `resourceUri` lets the
 * file-type icon show, and `BuilderFileDecorationProvider` adds the
 * SCM-style colored status-letter badge, mirroring VSCode's Git decorator.
 *

/**
 * Build the `resourceUri` for a builder changed-file row. Used by both
 * `BuilderFileTreeItem` (the tree item shown to the user) and
 * `BuilderDiffCache` (when firing decoration-change events) so the two
 * URIs match exactly — VSCode keys decoration cache entries by URI, so a
 * mismatch would leave stale decorations on screen.
 *
 * The path is **synthetic** (`/` + the worktree-relative path), NOT the real
 * worktree fs path. This is the crux of the #799 fix: VSCode's built-in Git
 * decorators (`GitDecorationProvider`, `GitIgnoreDecorationProvider`) do NOT
 * gate on `uri.scheme` — they resolve a repository by *path* and run
 * `git check-ignore` on it. With the real `.builders/<id>/…` path, Git
 * resolves the repo (main repo → path is gitignored; or the worktree's own
 * repo → tracked) and contributes a decoration that competes with ours. At
 * equal weight (the extension API exposes no weight; VSCode pins every
 * extension decoration to `weight: 10`), the color merge winner is
 * non-deterministic, and Git's grey `ignoredResourceForeground` — resolved
 * on a ~500ms debounce, after our synchronous decoration paints — overrides
 * our SCM color (the "correct color flashes, then grey" symptom; cf.
 * microsoft/vscode#187756). A path that resolves into *no* open repository
 * makes `getRepository(uri)` return undefined, so Git never fires and our
 * decoration is the sole (winning) color.
 *
 * The real worktree path rides in the query so our own provider / handlers
 * can recover it, and it keeps `uri.toString()` distinct per builder (two
 * builders can share the same relative path) so the decoration cache — keyed
 * by `uri.toString()` — doesn't collide. The file-type icon still resolves
 * because `IFileIconTheme` keys off the basename at the path tail.
