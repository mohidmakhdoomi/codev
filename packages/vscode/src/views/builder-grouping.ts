/**
 * Builder-grouping strategies — the swappable axis the Builders tree groups by
 * (#952). Each axis (`stage` | `area`) is one `BuilderGrouping` instance that
 * owns everything that varies per axis: how builders bucket into groups, the
 * complementary-axis row prefix, and whether a lone `Uncategorized` group
 * flattens. The provider holds one strategy per axis and delegates to the
 * active one, so there is no per-mode branching smeared across the view —
 * adding an axis is one more strategy object.
 *
 * Pure / vscode-free, so the strategies are unit-testable under the vitest
 * harness.
