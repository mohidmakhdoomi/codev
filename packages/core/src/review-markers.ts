/**
 * Review-marker codec — the single, host-agnostic home for the on-disk `REVIEW`
 * comment format and the transforms a rendered review surface needs.
 *
 * Background (#859): `@cluesmith/codev-artifact-canvas` renders Codev artifacts
 * (specs/plans/reviews) and lets a reviewer add inline comments. A comment is
 * serialized into the markdown as a positional HTML comment:
 *
 *     <!-- REVIEW(@<author>): <text> -->
 *
 * written on the line **after** the block it annotates. There is no `line=N`
 * attribute. The marker's *position in the file* is the entire line association:
 * a marker annotates the nearest non-marker line above it (so a stack of
 * comments on one block all resolve to that block). This convention
 * matches both the existing VSCode editor Comments-API path
 * (`packages/vscode/src/comments/plan-review.ts`) and the canvas package's own
 * tested adapter contract, so the two authoring surfaces round-trip through the
 * same bytes.
 *
 * This module lives in `core` (not in a host) because the convention is a
 * cross-host contract: the VSCode host consumes it now, and the dashboard /
 * future hosts consume the same functions so they cannot drift. It is pure
 * (no `vscode`, no DOM, no I/O) and therefore safe in both Node and the browser.
 *
 * Hiding markers from the rendered body is NOT done here: the canvas renderer
 * strips full-line HTML comments before parsing (keeping blocks intact and
 * `data-line` accurate), so hosts pass raw document text straight through. This
 * codec is purely the on-disk read/write convention (#1036 is fixed in the
 * renderer, #1042).
