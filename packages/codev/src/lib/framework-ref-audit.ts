/**
 * Audit a codev root for resolver-bypassing shell reads of framework files by
 * literal path (issue #1011, Layer 3 — regression guard).
 *
 * Used against two roots, for two purposes:
 *   - the framework's `codev-skeleton/` source, in the framework's own CI/unit
 *     test (guards what the package *ships*);
 *   - a project's local `codev/` overrides, by `codev doctor` (guards what the
 *     *user* customizes — the shipped skeleton is the framework's responsibility,
 *     not the end user's).
 *
 * The bug class: a builder-side consumer instructs `cat`/`cp` of a framework
 * doc by literal `codev/...` path. Shell commands bypass the four-tier resolver
 * (`resolveCodevFile`), so the read fails in fresh installs where the file
 * lives only in the embedded skeleton. Framework content is delivered to the
 * builder via the spawn prompt and porch JSON instead — never fetched by shell.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately NARROW to avoid false positives (the skeleton is full
 * of legitimate `codev/...` mentions):
 *   - Only shell-fetch verbs (cat/cp/less/more/head/tail/source) reading a
 *     `codev/protocols/...` or `codev/roles/...` path are flagged.
 *   - `codev/resources/` is NOT scanned: it mixes framework docs with
 *     user-evolved files (`arch.md`, `lessons-learned.md`) that builders and
 *     architects reference and write by path legitimately.
 *   - Plain documentation references (backtick mentions, "see codev/…") are
 *     NOT flagged. The rule is about *fetching*, not *referencing* — the
 *     protocol list in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md, for example, is intentional.
