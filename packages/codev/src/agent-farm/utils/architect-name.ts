 * Architect-name utilities (Spec 755).

 * - validateArchitectName: enforces the [a-z][a-z0-9-]* rule with a 64-char cap.
 * - autoNumberArchitectName: returns the next available `architect-<N>` name
 *   (smallest unused integer ≥ 2) given the set of already-registered names.
 *
 * `validateArchitectName`, `autoNumberArchitectName`, and the name constants
 * live in codev-core (Issue 841) so the VS Code extension's "Add Architect"
 * InputBox validates with the exact same rule Tower enforces server-side; we
 * re-export them here so existing agent-farm callsites are unaffected.
 * `currentArchitectName` reads the process env and stays local to this package.
